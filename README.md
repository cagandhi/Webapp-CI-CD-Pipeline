# DEVOPS-17 Project

## Milestone 1

### Project Setup
1. Clone the project.
2. Run: `npm intall`
3. Run: `npm link`

### Project Implementation
#### Configure Jenkins and build environment
`pipeline setup`

This command creates a new VM with static IP `192.168.33.20` and mounts the present working directory (`pwd`) onto `/bakerx` volume. It installs and configures Jenkins server, installs MongoDB, creates `MongoDB` user and installs `nodejs` required to run `checkbox.io` app.

#### Trigger a build job
`pipeline build <job_name> -u <jenkins_username> -p <jenkins_password>`

> -u and -p are optional parameters which default to `admin` and `admin`.

This command creates a new build job in Jenkins and triggers its build with the pipeline flow which can be seen in [pipeline.yml](cm/jobs/pipeline.yml) file.

### Experiences

* Setting up the system requires knowledge on where certain system files are. For example, we needed to know the that the jenkins configuration file is in location `/etc/default/jenkins` so that the default port to run Jenkins server can be changed. Another example is the enabling of passwordless execution of `sudo` commands by the `jenkins` user. We had to google search and find that we needed to add the privilege for `jenkins` user in `/etc/sudoers` file.
